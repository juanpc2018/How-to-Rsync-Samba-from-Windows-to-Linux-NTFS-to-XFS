# How-to-Rsync-Samba-from-Windows-to-Linux-NTFS-to-XFS

There are many tutorials on the Net,
but None works exactly for Kubuntu.
there are pieces here & there...
others are misleading / decoys.

Samba4.2
Requires winbind
Not installed by default in Kubuntu 21.10
synaptic, muon or similar package manager.

Share the Windows Folder,
Select a Proper User & Password,
Giving Full Rights to Everybody does Not work.

In Linux:
LuckyBackup is a GUI FrontEnd for Rsync, the advantage is that can store different settings / configurations.
similar to AllWaySync for Windows.
but...
Rsync only does ssh over Network.
but you want Samba
"Easy"
after creating a Windows Share in Dolphin / Nautilus, and testing the Windows Shared Drive / Folder is working in Nautilus / Dolphin.
then
you need to mount the SMB shared folder, to a folder Nautilus / Dolphin can detect.
as Local,
$ mkdir /media/UserName/cifs

but Â¿what the hell is cifs?
in FreeBSD is called smbfs
but in Debian is cifs "totally unrelated name"

you can see the FS your kernel support:
$ ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs

as recomended by:
$ man mount

there is No smbfs
but cifs is the same, with a weird name.
+1 point to FreeBSD,
-1 point for Kubuntu

$ mount -t cifs /source /destination

but Samba requires Login & Password.
minimum User Login
some passwords do Not work, if start with a character different than letters or numbers

$ mount -t cifs -o username=USERNAME,password=PASSWD //192.168.xxx.xxx/SharedDrivreOrFolder /media/user/cifs

if Password is Not compatible:

$ mount -t cifs -o username=USERNAME //192.168.xxx.xxx/SharedDrivreOrFolder /media/user/cifs

then will ask the password in Konsole,

and the Network Drive/Folder will appear in Dolphin / Nautilus as Local

then can be used as usual with luckyBakup.

Problems solved:
#1. Samba4.2 requires winbind
#2. Windows requires to Activate SMB2 & SMB3 and disable SMB1 in PowerShell.
#3. Windows shared Folder / Drive requires proper user & password.
#4. Windows SMB shared Folder / Drive, link needs to be Created in Dolphin Network.
#5. Windows SMB shared Folder / Drive needs to be mounted as local drive in Linux.
$6. then luckyBackup / Rsync will work as usual.
Rsync only works with ssh in Network,
No direct SMB.

DONE.

Option B)
Buy Linux NTFS drivers from Paragon
mount the NTFS HDD directly in Linux machine,
problem:
using Free Linux NTFS-3G drivers,
compatibility is Not 100% with large drives 18TB / 20TB.
Rsync will have problems when doing NTFS to XFS.
XFS is the Recomended File Format for Large/Big Mechanical Drives.
Ext4 is Not Recomended for Large/Big Mechanical Drives.

Problem is compatibility between:
Windows, Linux & OSX.

XFS is very good, but Only for Linux,
OSX and Windows have limited Read Only drivers from Paragon and FUSEOSX.

Free HFS+ driver for Linux is very limited / incomplete.
Free NTFS driver for Linux is better than HFS+ but Not 100%.
drivers break very easy with large drives.

NTFS requires constant defrag,
does Not allow ? and many other characters.
its very limited.
thats why Windows Server has ReFS Not NTFS.

Paragon has APFS drivers for Windows & Linux.
OSX has APFS support since OSX HighSierra 10.13.6

That could be the Only File System that is compatible with All systems.
but how does work with Large/Big Mechanical HDDs ? Unknown.

exFAT is free, comtabile between all systems,
but is a very inferior File System vs. others.
Emergency Only type.

If Paragon had full support for XFS in OSX and Windows,
that would be my to go FS.
